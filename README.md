Currently has a python script (test3.py) to sort tables (in a csv format), so from the command line, you'd type "python test3.py (insert the word you're looking for) (insert the file/folder to find in)". It can either either search a single csv file, or if you put multiple csv files in a folder, then it'll search through each of the files in that folder. If you want it to just search a csv file, make sure to include ".csv" in the file name.
